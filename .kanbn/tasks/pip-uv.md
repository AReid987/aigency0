# Pip ==> uv

- Pip, Conda, Poetry have each induced friction in my development process. 
- Only minimal research was completed on my part before making this determination. 
- Part of a larger task to optimize the performance of the underperforming Python packages currently in development

## Sub-tasks

- [ ] Identify all Aigency Python packages within the Turborepo
- [ ] Convert Highest Priority Packages to uv
- [ ] Test converted packages for compatibility and performance
