# Secure Additional Compute

- Pulling models, building docker images, starting containers is time consuming given the current state of GPU Poverty. 
- Seemingly free GPU and Compute Resources have been identified. Time to investigate

## Sub-tasks

- [ ] Research and list all viable free compute optons. (Collaborate with STORM, Perplexity, Harpa, Claude)
- [ ] Set up accounts and configure at least two free compute services
- [ ] Test model loading and inference on new compute resources
