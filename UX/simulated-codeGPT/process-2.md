Step 1: Create High-Fidelity Mockups

Let's begin with the dashboard mockup:

User avatar and notification bell in top right corner
Left sidebar: Dark gray (#333333) background with white icons for AI tools and integrations
Main area: White (#FFFFFF) background with light gray (#F8F9FA) widget containers
Widgets:
AI Task Queue: List view with task name, status, and progress bar
Recent Projects: Card view with project thumbnail, name, and last edited date
Performance Metrics: Line chart showing AI efficiency over time
Integration Status: Icon grid showing connected tools with green/red status indicators
"Add Widget" button: Pink (#FF006E) with white "+" icon
Typography: "Dashboard" in Poppins 24px, widget titles in Poppins 18px, body text in Inter 14px
Next, the Integration Page mockup:

Finally, the AI Insights Panel mockup:

Expandable sidebar: Slides in from the right, light gray (#F8F9FA) background
"AI Insights" title in Poppins 20px
Confidence level: Circular gauge with percentage in the center
Key factors: Icons with labels and small bar charts showing impact
AI parameter controls: Sliders and dropdowns for adjusting settings
"Learn More" button: Secondary purple (#8338EC) with white text
Close button: "X" icon in top right corner
Step 2: Develop Interactive Prototype

Using Figma, create an interactive prototype that demonstrates:

Onboarding flow:
Welcome screen → Industry selection → Role selection → AI demo → Key features → Integration setup → Dashboard customization → Completion
Dashboard interaction:
Clicking on widgets to expand
Adding a new widget
Accessing AI tools from the sidebar
Integration process:
Searching for an integration
Toggling an integration on/off
Connecting a new tool
Managing API keys
AI-assisted project creation:
Selecting a project type
Input fields for project parameters
Generating AI suggestions
Viewing and interacting with AI insights panel
Refining and approving results
Step 3: Recruit Usability Testing Participants

Create a screening questionnaire to find suitable participants:

What industry do you work in?
What is your current role?
How familiar are you with AI tools? (1-5 scale)
How often do you use productivity or project management software?
Are you available for a 45-minute remote usability test in the next two weeks?
Aim to recruit 5-7 participants with a mix of industries, roles, and AI familiarity levels.

Step 4: Prepare Testing Materials

Task Scenarios: a. Complete the onboarding process for Aigency. b. Customize your dashboard by adding and arranging widgets. c. Connect a new integration (e.g., Slack) to your Aigency account. d. Create a new AI-assisted project (e.g., content creation). e. Review AI insights for your project and make refinements.

Post-test Questionnaire:

System Usability Scale (SUS) questions
Open-ended questions:
What did you find most useful about Aigency?
What was the most confusing aspect of the interface?
How likely are you to use a tool like Aigency in your work?
Any additional comments or suggestions?
