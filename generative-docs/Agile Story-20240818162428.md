## What is an Agile Story?

  

An informal, generic explanation of a software feature written from the viewpoint of the end-user is known as an agile story or user story. Its objective is to explain how a software feature will benefit the user.

  

One of the essential elements of an agile program is the user story. They support the creation of a user-focused framework for daily work, which fosters creativity, collaboration, and the creation of better products in general.

  

  

## Why create an Agile Story?

  

User stories have the following major advantages:

  

**Stories keep the focus on the user**  
A list of tasks to be completed keeps the team focused, while a collection of tales keeps the team focused on finding solutions for actual users.

  

**Stories enable collaboration**  
The team can select how to best serve the user and accomplish the end objective once the end goal has been established.

  

**Stories drive creative solutions**  
The team is encouraged by stories to think critically and imaginatively about the best ways to achieve a goal.

  

**Stories create momentum**  
With each new narrative, the development team experiences a tiny difficulty and a small triumph, building momentum.
