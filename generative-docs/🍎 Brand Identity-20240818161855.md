# üî• Brand Identity Elements



## üçé Logo

_Images, phrases, and shapes representing a brand's name and mission can all be used as logos. Of course, a company's logo is the most important component of its identification because customers frequently notice it. You can also utilize a text logo, which is a unique typographic rendering of a brand name in text only. Since text-only logos are simpler to recall, more and more businesses are currently using them._

## üñãÔ∏è Font

_The corporate font you'll use on your website and in other marketing initiatives should be considered once you've chosen your logo. Find a font that grabs your attention and is simple to read. Proxima Nova, TT Norms Pro, and Helvetica Now are some of the top typefaces. Well-known companies like Spotify, Jeep, Bosh, Panasonic, and many others use them._

## üçé Shape and Form

_Another crucial element is a shape or form that defines your business and helps consumers recognize your product. Make sure your product packaging and form are memorable. As an illustration, McDonald's used a distinctive aspect for promotion successfully. The recognizable "M" form is now well-known on a global scale._
