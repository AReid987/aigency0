# 📝 Brand Introduction

Start your brand guidelines with a brand story that explains what your company is all about. Include the mission, vision, and key values of your organization, and if you can, add a little personality. Here, you can introduce yourself and the goals of your business to your employees, clients, and others in the community.

  

# 📌 Logo

Insert your brand logo here. Since mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and laptops have dark modes, you can also include what it looks like if users will be viewing your logo on a dark background.
